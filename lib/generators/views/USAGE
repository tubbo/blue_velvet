Description:
    Copies internal gem views for use in the main app. Any view files
    encountered in the app in the same location as those in the engine
    will override the default views, so this generator allows you to
    customize the display of your Facebook content.

Example:
    rails generate facebook:views

    This will create:
        app/views/facebook/page/_attribute_not_found.html.haml
        app/views/facebook/page/_page_attribute.html.haml
