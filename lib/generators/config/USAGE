Description:
    Creates YAML configuration in +config/facebook.yml+ which helps you
    connect to the Facebook platform. Required inherently by Koala, which
    forms the backend of this gem. Also creates a file in
    +config/initializers+ that helps set up Koala with this
    configuration. You may optionally use this file to pass
    configuration to Koala directly, as it conforms to most people's
    conventional use of the gem.

Example:
    rails generate facebook:config

    This will create:
        config/facebook.yml
        config/initializers/koala.rb
